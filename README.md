# Swasthya
“Swasthya” is a website which shall incubate the features like disease prediction, doctor suggestion, organ donation, relief funds generation, and also promoting the government projects and schemes that help the unprivileged people to get help in curing their diseases in the cheaper and effective manner, thus making the way for the social cause of self-help for people in curing their diseases.  Helping to transform the present system that serves the people,  we try to analyze their data and experiences to create a new kind of medical evidence and better and true picture of human health — and then we bring that evidence to the doctors to help them fill the gaps in how they treat their patients.
